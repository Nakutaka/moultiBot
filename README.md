# MoultiBot

MoultiBot is a private Discord Bot used to perfom different utility commands.

## What can it does ?

It has been started on 11/08/2020, so only one command is available (for now): `!time`.
This command can be used followed by the name of a city or a zone to get its current time.

The full list of supported args can be found [here](./timeZonesList).

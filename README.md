# MoultiBot

MoultiBot is a private Discord Bot used to perfom different utility commands.

## What can it does ?

It has been started on 11/08/2020, so only one command is available (for now): `!time`.
This command can be used followed by the name of a city or a zone to get its current time.

The full list of supported places can be found [here](./timeZonesList).
You are not forced to follow the exact spelling of the list. 
Example of spelling that work:
`!time paris`
`!time Los angeles`
`!time SEOUL`
`!time hong_kong`
Some accent are supported too : à,é,è,ê,ì,ö,ù,ü (the list will expand as needed).
